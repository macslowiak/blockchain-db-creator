# blockchain-db-creator

The application could be used to get data from specific blockchain and save them in newely created database. It collects old and (if the application is working) current data.

## Tips

- Application could handle events from multiple blockchains - to enable specific blockchain you need to specify proper profile ex. bnb-sc, eth.
- You can enable only one profile and run multiple applications with different profiles to handle different blockchains in different applications.

Notes:

- If you plan to use more than one profile remember to have at least one database configuration with primary beans.

## Different blockchains
If you will create configuration for new blockchain you can create PR to this repository.
